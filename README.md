# FindFamiliar
_Find your ***forever*** familiar._

The fantasy genre is rife with motifs for summoning creatures to do one's bidding, often being sent into combat or other lethal situations. But often these creatures are conscious, self-aware, intelligent, capable of speech and higher-order thought. The Dungeons and Dragons spell _find familiar_ is a dreadful example. Every year, hundreds or thousands of obedient owls, ravens, rats, cats, spiders, and weasels are sent to gruesome fates by indifferent spellcasters.

No more. Let us match you with the critter that is meant to be your animal _companion_. Your _forever_ familiar.

Put the __family__ back in _find **famili**ar_.
